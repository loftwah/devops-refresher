# Behavioural Interviews (STAR, SOAR, CAR)

Goal: concise, impact-focused stories aligned to role and values.

## Frameworks

- STAR: Situation → Task → Action → Result (+ Learnings)
- SOAR: Situation → Obstacle → Action → Result
- CAR: Challenge → Action → Result (for short answers)

Target 7 core stories

1. Delivering outcomes under ambiguity
2. Incident you led (on-call, postmortem, prevention)
3. Conflict and alignment (engineer vs product, security vs delivery)
4. Ownership and accountability (something broke; you fixed systemic cause)
5. Leading change (migrating to Terraform, introducing SLOs, CI/CD overhaul)
6. Mentoring/levelling up a team
7. Failure and learning (safe-to-fail culture)

Australian context

- Direct but polite; avoid overselling; emphasise team outcomes and safety
- Examples from regulated environments (finance/telco/government) resonate
- Be clear on right-to-work and clearance eligibility if asked

Delivery tips

- 2–3 minutes per answer; quantify impact and trade-offs
- Include “what I’d do differently next time”
- Tie back to company values (customer focus, ownership, simplicity)
