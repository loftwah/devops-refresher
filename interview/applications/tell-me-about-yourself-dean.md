# 60‑Second “Tell Me About Yourself” — Dean Lofts

I’m a Melbourne‑based senior DevOps/Platform engineer who builds reliable platforms and simple, safe delivery pipelines. Recently, I’ve delivered mission‑critical services under tight timelines, modernised legacy apps onto containers, and codified guardrails with Terraform across AWS.

Two quick examples: at Operoo, I stood up a self‑healing streaming service in 72 hours using ECS/EC2 with CI/CD and clear runbooks. I also migrated four legacy apps from Heroku to AWS (ECS + RDS) with GitHub Actions pipelines, improving release safety and operational clarity.

Outside of work, I productised two projects: LoftwahFM, an AI music + radio segments platform running on Cloudflare Workers with seamless 24/7 streaming; and TechDeck, a Rails app with a Stripe‑gated AI pipeline that generates “trading cards” from public X profiles with a directory and API. They keep me hands‑on end‑to‑end — infra, CI/CD, security, and user experience.

I’m looking for a role where I can enable teams with paved paths — think AWS/EKS, Terraform, and CI/CD — and raise reliability with SLOs, observability, and safe rollouts. I’m Melbourne‑based and comfortable designing for `ap-southeast-4` with DR to `-2`.
