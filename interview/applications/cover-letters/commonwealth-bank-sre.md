# Cover Letter — SRE @ Commonwealth Bank (Example)

Hiring Manager,

What I want

- I’m applying for SRE to improve reliability and auditability for your customer-facing platforms in Melbourne.

Why me (match the JD)

- SLOs/SLIs & Incident Response — Implemented Prometheus/Grafana with alert routing; cut Sev‑1s by 40% (aws-labs/16-observability, docs/runbooks/\*).
- Auditability & Controls — Codified IAM/SG baselines and CloudTrail evidence in Terraform (docs/iam.md, docs/security-groups.md, docs/cloudtrail.md, aws-labs/06-iam, 07-security-groups).
- Safe Delivery — Blue/green and canary via Helm on EKS with ALB/TLS (aws-labs/18-eks-alb-externaldns, demo-node-app/deploy/eks/chart/).

Proof

- Portfolio: EKS + CI/CD with DR plans across `ap-southeast-4` and `-2` and ADRs on TLS and CI ownership.

Close

- I’d welcome a chat about how I can raise reliability while keeping auditors happy. Thanks for your time.

Regards,
Your Name
