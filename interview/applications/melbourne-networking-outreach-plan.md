# Melbourne Networking & Outreach Plan (DevOps/SRE)

Purpose: build signal and warm intros in Melbourne/VIC and AU‑wide.

## Channels (Where)

- Meetups: DevOps Melbourne, Cloud Native/Kubernetes Melbourne, AWS User Group Melbourne, SRE/Observability meetups.
- Communities: local Slack/Discord (e.g., DevOps/SRE AU groups), LinkedIn Groups.
- Recruiters: Hays, Michael Page, Robert Half, Peoplebank; in‑house talent at target companies.
- Events: AWS Summits, Kubernetes/Cloud Native events, engineering talks.

## Outreach Scripts (How)

- Hiring Manager/Engineer
  - “Hi <Name> — I’m targeting <role>. I’ve built <X> relevant to <JD keyword> (repo: <link to path, e.g., aws-labs/20-cicd-eks-pipeline/>). 15 min to learn about <team/stack>? Happy to share specifics.”
- Recruiter (agency)
  - “Hi <Name>, I focus on <skills>. Recently shipped EKS via Terraform and CI/CD with guardrails; Melbourne‑based and open to <perm/contract>. Any roles for <title>?”
- Event follow‑up
  - “Great talk on <topic>. I’m working on something similar (<repo path>). Would love 10–15 min to compare approaches and learn about your team’s priorities.”

## Weekly Cadence (When)

- Mon: Review 10–20 new roles (Seek + LinkedIn); apply to 5 with tailored resume.
- Tue: Attend 1 meetup or engage in 2 online threads with substantive comments.
- Wed: 3 outreach messages (1 hiring manager/engineer, 1 recruiter, 1 community contact).
- Thu: Portfolio update (diagram/runbook/ADR) and share 1 learning post.
- Fri: Follow up with anyone not responded after 5–7 days; book coffee chats.

## What To Share (What/Why)

- Short write‑ups linking repo artifacts: EKS via Terraform (`aws-labs/17-eks-cluster/`), ALB/ExternalDNS (`aws-labs/18-eks-alb-externaldns/`), CI/CD to EKS (`aws-labs/20-cicd-eks-pipeline/`), observability (`aws-labs/16-observability/`).
- Why: demonstrates applied skills and creates conversation starters.

## Melbourne Practicalities

- State hybrid preference clearly (most roles are hybrid 2–3 days on‑site).
- Mention `ap-southeast-4` experience and DR to `-2` in designs.
- Highlight right‑to‑work and any clearance eligibility early.
