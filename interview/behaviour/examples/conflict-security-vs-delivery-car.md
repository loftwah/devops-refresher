# Example: Conflict — Security vs Delivery — CAR

Challenge

- Security requested blanket change freeze; product needed critical fix release.

Action

- Facilitated risk‑based approach: 5% canary with auto‑rollback; OPA policy checks; extra observability during the window; pre‑approved gates.

Result

- Released the fix within policy; zero incidents; policy updated to allow risk‑based exceptions with evidence.
