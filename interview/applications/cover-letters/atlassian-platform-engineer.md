# Cover Letter — Platform Engineer @ Atlassian (Example)

Hiring Manager,

What I want

- I’m applying for Platform Engineer to build paved paths on AWS/EKS that help teams ship faster and safer.

Why me (match the JD)

- Paved Paths — EKS via Terraform modules with IRSA and OPA policies; Helm templates (aws-labs/17-eks-cluster, aws-labs/kubernetes/policies, kubernetes/helm/demo-app).
- CI/CD & Deploys — Reusable pipelines to EKS with canary/blue-green and gates (aws-labs/20-cicd-eks-pipeline, demo-node-app/buildspec.yml, ADR-007).
- Observability — Prometheus/Grafana with SLOs and alert routing (aws-labs/16-observability).

Proof

- Portfolio: end-to-end platform examples with ADRs documenting trade-offs; region-aware designs for AU.

Close

- Would love to chat about developer experience, tenancy isolation, and policy-as-code at Atlassian scale.

Regards,
Your Name
