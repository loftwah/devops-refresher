# Cover Letter — Cloud Engineer @ Telstra (Example)

Hiring Manager,

What I want

- I’m applying for Cloud Engineer to harden AWS foundations and improve change safety across networked services.

Why me (match the JD)

- Networking & Boundaries — Built VPC with endpoints and route controls via Terraform (aws-labs/01-vpc, 02-vpc-endpoints; docs/vpc.md).
- HA & Change Safety — Implemented ALB/TLS with blue/green on EKS; runbooks for rollback (aws-labs/12-alb, 18-eks-alb-externaldns, docs/runbooks/\*).
- Audit & IAM — Documented TLS termination decisions and codified IAM/SG baselines (docs/decisions/ADR-001-alb-tls-termination.md, docs/iam.md, docs/security-groups.md).

Proof

- Portfolio: CI/CD to EKS with policy and DR between `ap-southeast-4` and `-2`.

Close

- Happy to discuss how I’d keep changes safe at Telstra scale. Thanks for your time.

Regards,
Your Name
