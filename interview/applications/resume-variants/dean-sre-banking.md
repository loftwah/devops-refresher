Headline

- SRE (SLOs/SLIs, Incident Response, AWS, Terraform, CI/CD)

Summary

- SRE focused on reliability and auditability in regulated environments. Implemented SLOs, reduced incident volume/MTTR, and codified controls in Terraform. Melbourne‑based; design for `ap-southeast-4` with DR to `-2`.

Core Skills

- Reliability: SLOs/SLIs, alert routing, incident command, runbooks
- AWS: EKS/ECS, ALB, RDS, CloudWatch, CloudTrail | IaC: Terraform
- Delivery: blue/green, canary, rollback under 5 minutes | CI/CD: GHA/CodeBuild
- Security: IAM, SGs, secrets, zero trust (Tailscale)

Experience Highlights (evidence)

- Prometheus/Grafana SLOs and alerts; incident runbooks → reduced Sev‑1s (repo: `aws-labs/16-observability`, `docs/runbooks/*`).
- Codified IAM/SG baselines; CloudTrail evidence capture in Terraform (repo: `docs/iam.md`, `docs/security-groups.md`, `docs/cloudtrail.md`).
- Safe rollouts on ALB/EKS with Helm; rollback <5m (repo: `aws-labs/18-eks-alb-externaldns`, `demo-node-app/deploy/eks/chart/`).

Projects (optional)

- LoftwahFM (Cloudflare Workers): productised streaming with on‑brand audio; privacy‑safe licensing posture (`applications/projects/loftwahfm.md`).
- TechDeck (Rails + Stripe): live directory/API with small paid submissions; lean, auditable ops (`applications/projects/techdeck.md`).
