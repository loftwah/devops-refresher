# Privacy‑Safe Storytelling (APS/Gov + Private)

Principles

- Speak to process, controls, and outcomes — not internal numbers or sensitive details.
- Use observable facts: “self‑healing design, no customer‑reported downtime,” “rollback in one step,” “audit finding closed.”
- Point to public or repo artifacts as proof without revealing confidential data.

Structure

- Situation: scope, constraints, and risk in generic terms (e.g., “regulated environment,” “change freeze,” “PII present”).
- Action: what you built/changed and why, trade‑offs, and controls (guardrails, policy, runbooks).
- Outcome: qualitative impact and verifiable states (stable operations, safer releases, clearer audit trail).

Do/Don’t

- Do: say “minutes, not hours,” “same‑day,” “on‑demand releases.”
- Don’t: share exact volumes, dollar amounts, internal SLAs, or proprietary configs.

Safe example phrases

- “Self‑healing service; no customer‑reported downtime after launch.”
- “Enabled safe canary with auto‑rollback; releases during freeze without incidents.”
- “Least‑privilege IAM and SG baselines codified; audit trail is automatic.”
- “SLOs and alert routing; faster resolution with clear runbooks.”
