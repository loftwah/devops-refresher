# Cover Letter — DevOps @ Bunnings (Example)

Hiring Manager,

What I want

- I’m applying for DevOps to help Bunnings ship faster and safer, with simple, cost‑aware pipelines and reliable platforms.

Why me (match the JD)

- CI/CD Velocity — Templated pipelines with caching, image scanning, and deploy gates; p95 <15m (aws-labs/20-cicd-eks-pipeline, demo-node-app/buildspec.yml).
- Reliable Rollouts — Blue/green and canary on EKS behind ALB/TLS; clear rollback (aws-labs/18-eks-alb-externaldns, demo-node-app/deploy/eks/chart/).
- Observability & Cost — Prometheus/Grafana SLOs and dashboards; right‑size resources and retention (aws-labs/16-observability).

Proof

- Portfolio: end‑to‑end examples with ADRs describing trade‑offs and outcomes; Melbourne‑ready `ap-southeast-4` with DR to `-2`.

Close

- I’d love to chat about pragmatic ways to keep costs predictable while improving delivery speed and stability.

Regards,
Your Name
