# 30‑Second Recruiter Screen — Dean Lofts

I’m a Melbourne‑based senior DevOps/Platform engineer. I build reliable AWS platforms and simple, safe CI/CD — recently delivering a self‑healing streaming service under tight timelines and migrating legacy apps from Heroku to AWS (ECS + RDS) with GitHub Actions. Outside work, I productised LoftwahFM (Cloudflare Workers streaming) and TechDeck (Rails + Stripe AI pipeline). I’m looking for Platform/SRE roles where I can enable teams with Terraform + EKS and raise reliability with SLOs and safe rollouts.
