# Applications (DevOps, Australia-first)

Purpose: help you get more interviews with stronger applications tailored to DevOps roles in Australia (and globally).

## Strategy At A Glance

1. Define target roles → collect 10 JDs (Seek + LinkedIn)
2. Extract recurring skills → build a keyword map
3. Tailor a 1-page, impact-first resume per JD
4. Optimise LinkedIn for recruiter search (headline, About, skills)
5. Network with intent (informational chats + referrals)

## What “Good” Looks Like

- Impact-first bullets with metrics: cost, time, reliability, scale
- Clear stack: cloud (AWS/GCP/Azure), IaC (Terraform/CDK), CI/CD, containers (Docker/K8s), observability (Prometheus/Grafana), scripting (Python/Bash)
- ATS-friendly: no images/tables; standard section headers; PDF
- Tailored keywords that mirror the JD (don’t keyword-stuff)
- 1 page (2 max if 10+ years, but still concise)

## Australian Market Nuances

- Platforms: Seek, LinkedIn Jobs, company career sites, Hays/Michael Page/Robert Half, Meetups (Syd/Melb/Bris), Slack communities (e.g., DevOps Sydney)
- Roles: Platform Engineer, SRE, DevOps Engineer, Cloud Engineer, Build/Release, Infra Engineer
- Clearances: NV1/NV2/Baseline (government/defence) – mention eligibility
- Right to work: citizens/PRs/visas – be explicit
- Salary bands vary: metro vs regional; contract rates often daily (inc/ex GST)

## Tailoring Checklist (Per Application)

- Rewrite headline summary to match JD outcomes
- Reorder skills so JD-matching stack appears first
- Swap 3–5 bullets in most recent roles to mirror JD verbs
- Add exact cloud/IaC/CI keywords the JD uses
- Add 1–2 relevant projects (link to repo if public)

## Useful Paths In This Repo

- `aws-labs/*` – reference in bullets for cloud/IaC
- `networking-labs/*` – reference for networking fundamentals
- `demo-node-app/*` – reference for CI/CD examples

## Deliverables

- One base resume + role-specific variants
- Optimised LinkedIn profile (headline, About, Featured)
- A target company list with tracked outreach and referrals
