# Scenario: SRE @ Canva (Hypothetical)

Role Snapshot

- Own availability and performance for user-facing services; drive SLOs, capacity planning, incident response, and resilience testing.

Behavioural (choose 2)

- Post-incident learning you led that changed on-call outcomes
- Persuading teams to adopt SLOs and error budgets

Coding

- Write a script to compute SLI (availability) from HTTP status logs and evaluate against a monthly SLO.

System Design

- Design a global image rendering pipeline with AU primary region; discuss caching, queueing, autoscaling, and multi-region read replicas.
- SLO: p95 render < 300ms in AU; 99.9% monthly.

Evaluation Hooks

- Degradation strategies, overload protection, CDN strategy, cost/perf trade-offs
