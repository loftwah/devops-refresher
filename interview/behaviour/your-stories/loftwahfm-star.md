# LoftwahFM — STAR (Productisation & Platform)

Situation

- Businesses needed on‑brand music and announcements without licensing headaches or long studio timelines; existing solutions were generic or costly.

Task

- Build a privacy‑safe, on‑brand AI music and radio segment platform with continuous streaming and simple operations.

Action

- Designed end‑to‑end pipeline: brief → AI composition → script → AI voiceover → mastered segment.
- Implemented platform on Cloudflare Workers (TypeScript/Astro) with R2/D1 for storage; seamless 24/7 playlists with branded segments.
- Established clear licensing posture (original compositions) and streamlined operations (simple deploys, no PII).

Result

- Production site with streaming demo and deliverables for customers; stable operations and seamless loops; straightforward commercial usage rights.

Learnings

- Keeping infra simple (edge workers + object/store) enables fast iteration; productised pipelines reduce operational toil.
