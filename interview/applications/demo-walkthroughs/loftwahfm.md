# Demo Walkthrough — LoftwahFM (2–3 minutes)

Goal

- Show productisation, platform design, and pragmatic operations without sensitive data.

Flow

- 10s: One‑liner — “AI music + branded radio segments, streamed 24/7 for venues.”
- 20s: Problem → value — licensing hassles and generic music vs on‑brand, royalty‑free tracks in days.
- 40s: Architecture — Cloudflare Workers (TypeScript/Astro), R2/D1 storage, pipeline for script→AI voice→mastered segment, seamless loops.
- 40s: Ops — simple deployments, no PII, clear licensing posture; observability basics; self‑hosted streaming demo.
- 20s: Tie‑back — how this reflects paved paths, IaC mindset, and reliability focus.

Screen flow

- Show link hub → fm.loftwah.com landing → sample playlist → brief “how it works” section.

Close

- “Happy to discuss how I’d apply the same productisation and ops patterns to your platform.”
