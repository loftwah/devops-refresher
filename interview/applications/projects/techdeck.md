# Project: TechDeck — AI‑Powered Trading Cards for Tech Twitter/X

One-liner

- AI‑generated “trading cards” for tech profiles with stats/tags, a searchable directory, JSON API, and social leaderboards.

What (Product)

- Stripe‑gated submissions; cards generated from public X profile data, recent activity, and linked content.
- Directory entry + API; potential physical edition for early profiles; leaderboards for growth/effort/consistency.

Why (Value)

- Discovery engine for high‑signal tech profiles; portable, shareable card assets; programmatic API for builders.

How (Tech)

- Ruby on Rails, sqlite, kamal, DigitalOcean, mission control, solidqueue, Google Gemini (Flash 2.5).
- $3.50 submission via Stripe to reduce noise and fund ops; JSON endpoints for integration.

Outcomes (Privacy‑safe)

- Live users and payments via Stripe; directory/API in production.

Resume bullets (pick 1–2)

- Built an AI pipeline in Rails (solidqueue + Gemini) that turns public X data into collectible profile “cards” with a searchable directory and JSON API; gated via Stripe.
- Shipped leaderboards and directory search with pragmatic hosting (kamal on DigitalOcean); operated production with simple, auditable ops.
