Headline

- DevOps/SRE (Secure Delivery, AWS, Terraform, EKS, Observability)

Summary

- Security‑minded DevOps/SRE improving release safety, least‑privilege access, and actionable observability. Hardened CI/CD and runtime on AWS/EKS using Terraform, image scanning, and clear runbooks.

Core Skills

- AWS (EKS, ALB, ECR, RDS), Terraform, Docker, CI/CD (GitHub Actions/CodeBuild), Prometheus/Grafana, IAM/SGs, Secrets Mgmt, Supply chain hardening

Experience (Repo‑anchored)
Project Portfolio | 2024–Present

- Hardened CI/CD: multi‑stage Docker builds, image scanning and deploy gates; provenance strategy and artifact ownership (demo-node-app/Dockerfile, demo-node-app/buildspec.yml, docs/decisions/ADR-006-artifacts-bucket-policy-ownership.md, docs/validation-strategy.md).
- Least privilege: codified IAM/SG baselines and secrets handling (docs/iam.md, docs/security-groups.md, aws-labs/kubernetes/manifests/_secrets_).
- Observability: SLOs and alert routing with Prometheus/Grafana; MTTR reduction (aws-labs/16-observability, docs/runbooks/\*).
- EKS/Ingress: ALB/TLS and ExternalDNS; safe blue/green and canary (aws-labs/18-eks-alb-externaldns).
