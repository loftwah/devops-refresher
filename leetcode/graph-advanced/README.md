# Advanced Graphs Pattern Hub

These problems extend basic traversal with specialised structures like union-find, Dijkstra, or topological sortingâ€”exactly the tools you need for large-scale infra graph reasoning.

## Core Techniques

- **Union-Find (Disjoint Set Union)**: Efficiently merge and query connectivity.
- **Topological Sort / Kahn's Algorithm**: Process directed acyclic graphs respecting dependencies.
- **Shortest Path with Weights**: Dijkstra, Bellman-Ford, or BFS with priority queues.

## Target Problems

- Number of Connected Components in an Undirected Graph (union-find)
- Redundant Connection / Accounts Merge
- Course Schedule / Course Schedule II (topological order)
- Alien Dictionary (build ordering from constraints)
- Network Delay Time / Cheapest Flights Within K Stops (weighted shortest path)

## DevOps Parallels

- VPC peering and transit gateway connectivity checks.
- Terraform apply order across interdependent stacks.
- Optimising data replication paths or message broker routes.
