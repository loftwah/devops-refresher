# Cover Letter — DevOps @ AWS (Example)

Hiring Manager,

What I want

- I’m applying for DevOps to help AWS customers ship faster and safer by applying well‑architected, IaC, and secure delivery practices.

Why me (match the JD)

- Well‑Architected Foundations — Terraform modules across VPC/IAM/ALB/RDS with clear guardrails (aws-labs/01-vpc, 02-vpc-endpoints, 06-iam, 12-alb, 09-rds).
- Secure Delivery — CI/CD with image scanning, artifact ownership, and deploy gates (demo-node-app/buildspec.yml, docs/decisions/ADR-006-artifacts-bucket-policy-ownership.md, docs/validation-strategy.md).
- Operability — SLOs/SLIs and runbooks; measurable reliability improvements (aws-labs/16-observability, docs/runbooks/\*).

Proof

- Portfolio: multi‑account‑ready patterns and ADRs that explain trade‑offs and customer outcomes.

Close

- I’m excited to raise the bar for customers on reliability and speed with pragmatic patterns and clear documentation.

Regards,
Your Name
