# Binary Search Pattern Hub

Binary search problems are about shrinking search space deliberately—whether the domain is indices, answer space, or time. Apply the mindset whenever you can compare midpoints to a target property.

## Core Techniques

- **Classic Binary Search** on sorted arrays or matrices.
- **Binary Search on Answer**: Determine the smallest/largest feasible value by testing midpoints.
- **Search in Rotated Arrays**: Understand ordered halves even when global order breaks.

## Target Problems

- Binary Search template refresher (iterative and recursive)
- Search in Rotated Sorted Array / Find Minimum in Rotated Sorted Array
- First Bad Version (API-driven search)
- Koko Eating Bananas / Split Array Largest Sum (binary search the answer)
- Median of Two Sorted Arrays (advanced partition search)

## DevOps Parallels

- Pinpointing the deployment that introduced a regression (git bisect analogy).
- Dialling in autoscaling thresholds by testing midpoints quickly.
- Determining minimal viable resources that pass a performance benchmark.
