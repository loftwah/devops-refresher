# Example mapping of GNS3 nodes/interfaces to roles and addresses

core:
  wan_if: eth0 # to Internet cloud
  d1_if: eth1 # to dist-a (10.0.1.1/30)
  d2_if: eth2 # to dist-b (10.0.2.1/30)
  wan_gw: 198.51.100.1

dist-a:
  uplink_if: eth0 # to core (10.0.1.2/30)
  trunk_if: eth1 # to edge-1 (carries VLAN 10,20)

dist-b:
  uplink_if: eth0 # to core (10.0.2.2/30)
  trunk_if: eth1 # to edge-2 (carries VLAN 10,20)

edge-1:
  br_if: br0 # Linux bridge with access ports

edge-2:
  br_if: br0

dhcp:
  connect_to: core

notes:
  - Adjust interface names to match GNS3 VM templates
  - Apply FRR configs from the frr/ subfolders to the matching nodes
