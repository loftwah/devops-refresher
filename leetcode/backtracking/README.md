# Backtracking Pattern Hub

Backtracking explores solution spaces by making choices, recursing, and undoing those choices. It mirrors design reviews where you explore possibilities, reject invalid ones, and keep viable architectures.

## Core Techniques

- **Permutation Generation**: Swap or choose/skip patterns to enumerate orders.
- **Combination Enumeration**: Build subsets, handle duplicates with sorting + pruning.
- **Constraint Satisfaction**: Early pruning with validity checks (N-Queens, Sudoku).

## Target Problems

- Permutations / Permutations II
- Combination Sum / Combination Sum II
- Subsets / Subsets II
- Palindrome Partitioning
- N-Queens / Sudoku Solver

## DevOps Parallels

- Evaluating environment permutations for deployment plans.
- Exhaustively checking monitoring rule combinations for conflicts.
- Simulating policy combinations to find valid security configurations.

> Keep recursion trees verbal: describe each decision branch so audio learners can follow the “try, recurse, undo” loop.
