This application exists in [loftwah/demo-node-app](https://github.com/loftwah/demo-node-app). Please refer to that repository for any information on the application.

## GitHub Container Registry

[demo-node-app](https://github.com/loftwah/demo-node-app/pkgs/container/demo-node-app)

There is a CI pipeline running in GitHub Actions that builds the application and pushes the image to the GitHub Container Registry. We aren't using this for the labs, but it's a good example of how to build and push an image to a container registry.
