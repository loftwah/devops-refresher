Platform Engineer (Atlassian/Scale‑up style)

- About: SRE focused on reliability and auditability. Implemented SLOs and alert routing, codified IAM/SG and CloudTrail evidence with Terraform, and shipped canary/blue‑green behind ALB. Design with `ap-southeast-4` primary, DR to `-2`.

DevOps Engineer (Retail/Telco)

- Headline: DevOps | CI/CD, Docker, ECS/EKS | Faster, Safer Releases (Melbourne)
- About: I ship simple, safe pipelines and reliable container platforms. GitHub Actions + Ruby/AWS SDK pipelines, ECS/EKS deploys, and clear rollback/runbooks. Repo proofs: CI/CD and Helm deploys; ALB/TLS strategy; IAM/SG baselines.

Security‑leaning (CrowdStrike‑style)

Generic (Blog tone)

- Headline: Senior DevOps/Platform Engineer | AWS, Docker, Terraform, Ruby/Go | Melbourne
- About: I build efficient, scalable cloud infrastructure and ship impactful solutions end‑to‑end. I’ve migrated legacy Rails apps to modern AWS platforms, turning months into days, and I productise ideas — from LoftwahFM (Cloudflare Workers streaming) to TechDeck (Rails + Stripe + AI). I care about reliability, simplicity, and docs that make teams faster.
