# Trees & Graphs Pattern Hub

Tree and graph problems teach traversal, reachability, and relationship reasoning. They map directly to dependency management, network topology, and IAM evaluations.

## Core Techniques

- **Depth-First Search (DFS)**: Recursive or iterative stack-based exploration.
- **Breadth-First Search (BFS)**: Queue-based expansion for shortest paths.
- **Topological Ordering**: Directed acyclic graphs and dependency resolution.
- **Union-Find**: Track connected components efficiently.

## Target Problems

- Number of Islands / Max Area of Island (grid DFS/BFS)
- Clone Graph (graph traversal with hash maps)
- Binary Tree Level Order Traversal & Zigzag Level Order
- Lowest Common Ancestor of a BST / Binary Tree
- Course Schedule (topological sort)

## DevOps Parallels

- Evaluating network reachability (security groups, routing tables).
- Understanding Terraform module dependencies before apply.
- Propagating IAM permissions through role hierarchies.
