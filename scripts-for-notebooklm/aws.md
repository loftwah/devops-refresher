Part 2: AWS — Credentials, Profiles, ECS, ECR, ALB, CodeBuild, CodePipeline, RDS Postgres, ElastiCache Redis (Complete Spoken Refresher)
Alright, Dean, let’s dive into AWS, and I’m going all in — this is a massive, verbose, spoken-style refresher covering everything you asked for: AWS credentials and profiles with ~/.aws/config and ~/.aws/credentials, ECS, ECR, ALB, CodeBuild, CodePipeline, RDS Postgres, and ElastiCache Redis. It’s designed to be thrown straight into your text-to-speech tool, so you can listen to it on repeat while you’re driving, working out, or doing whatever, and drill every detail into your brain without needing a screen. I’ll narrate it as if I’m sitting next to you, walking through every step, every command, every concept, with practical examples tied to a real-world project like a Rails app you might deploy. I’ll spell out commands clearly, like “aws space s3 space ls,” so your TTS reads them perfectly. Each section will include what it is, why it matters, when you’d use it, and a step-by-step example. No bullet points, just a flowing monologue with repetition for reinforcement. This is Part 2 only — no Git, no Terraform, no Sidekiq, just AWS as you specified. It’s going to be long, detailed, and exhaustive, covering every angle you need to be bulletproof. Let’s get started.
We begin with setting up your AWS credentials and profiles, because without these, you can’t do anything in AWS. Everything in AWS starts with authentication — proving who you are and what you’re allowed to do. You interact with AWS through the command line interface, or CLI, so first you make sure it’s installed. Open your terminal and type aws space dash dash version. If it prints something like “aws-cli/2.17.0 Python/3.11.9 Linux/6.8.0-45-generic,” you’re good. If not, install it. On Linux, you might use curl space -o space awscliv2.zip space https colon slash slash awscli.amazonaws.com slash awscli-exe-linux-x86_64.zip, then unzip awscliv2.zip, and run sudo space ./aws/install. On macOS, brew space install space awscli. On Windows, download the MSI from aws.amazon.com/cli or use winget space install space dash dash id Amazon.AWSCLI. Why check the version? Newer versions have better features, like SSO support, and you need to know what you’re working with if you hit a bug.
Once the CLI is installed, you configure it to authenticate to AWS. AWS looks for credentials in two files in your home directory: tilde slash .aws slash credentials and tilde slash .aws slash config. These are hidden files in a hidden folder called .aws. The credentials file holds your access keys, which are like a username and password for programmatic access. The config file holds settings like your default region, output format, and profile definitions. Never commit these files to Git, because leaking access keys is a security disaster — anyone who gets them can control your AWS resources.
Let’s set up a profile. A profile is a named set of credentials and settings, useful when you work with multiple AWS accounts, like one for personal projects, one for work. To configure, type aws space configure space dash dash profile space work. The CLI prompts for four things: access key ID, secret access key, default region, and output format. You paste the access key ID, which looks like AKIA followed by a string of letters and numbers. Then the secret access key, a longer string. For region, since you’re in Melbourne, type ap-southeast-2 — that’s Sydney, the closest AWS region. For output, type json for machine-readable output, or text for simpler reading. This writes to ~/.aws/credentials under [work] with the keys, and to ~/.aws/config under [profile work] with the region and output.
What does that look like? In ~/.aws/credentials, you’d have a section starting with [work], then aws_access_key_id equals AKIA-something, and aws_secret_access_key equals a-long-secret-string. In ~/.aws/config, you’d have [profile work], region equals ap-southeast-2, output equals json. Why use profiles? They let you switch between accounts easily. Example: you’re working on your LoftwahFM project in your personal account and a client project in a work account. You run aws s3 ls --profile work to list buckets in the work account, then aws s3 ls --profile personal for your own.
Now, a better way than long-lived keys is AWS SSO or IAM Identity Center. It’s more secure because you authenticate through a browser and get temporary credentials. To set it up, type aws space configure space sso space dash dash profile space work. It asks for your SSO start URL, something like https://yourcompany.awsapps.com/start, and the SSO region, like ap-southeast-2. You log in via browser, select the account and role, and the CLI caches a token in ~/.aws/sso/cache. To use it, type aws space sso space login space dash dash profile space work. Why SSO? No static keys to leak, and it integrates with your company’s identity provider. Example: your employer uses Okta; you log in once, and all CLI commands with --profile work just work for the session.
If you need to assume an IAM role, say for a client’s account, you configure it in ~/.aws/config. You add a section like [profile client], role_arn equals arn:aws:iam::account-id:role/role-name, source_profile equals work, and maybe mfa_serial equals arn:aws:iam::account-id:mfa/your-mfa-device if MFA is required. To use, type aws space sts space assume-role space dash dash profile space client, or just run any command with --profile client, and it prompts for an MFA code if needed. Why roles? They give temporary credentials, reducing risk. Example: you’re consulting for a client; you assume their Developer role, run aws ec2 describe-instances --profile client, and see their instances without storing their keys.
To verify who you are, type aws space sts space get-caller-identity space dash dash profile space work. It returns your user or role ARN, account ID, and session ID if temporary. Why? Confirms your credentials work and which identity you’re using. Example: you run it and see you’re User/DeanLofts in account 123456789012, so you know you’re in the right account.
For debugging config issues, type aws space configure space list space dash dash profile space work. This shows where your region, access key, and other settings are coming from. Why? Helps when commands fail due to wrong region or credentials. Example: you try aws s3 ls and get access denied; this command shows you’re using the wrong profile.
Now, let’s move to the Application Load Balancer, or ALB. ALB is a Layer 7 load balancer, meaning it understands HTTP and HTTPS traffic, so you can route based on URLs, hostnames, or headers. It’s perfect for directing traffic to ECS services or EC2 instances. You create an ALB in a VPC, and it needs at least two public subnets in different availability zones for high availability — say, ap-southeast-2a and ap-southeast-2b. Why? AWS requires redundancy to handle zone failures.
You start by setting up the ALB. In the console, you’d choose ALB, name it, say my-app-alb, and select your VPC and subnets. You attach a security group that allows inbound traffic on port 80 for HTTP or 443 for HTTPS, and outbound to your backend ports, like 3000 for a Rails app. For HTTPS, you need a certificate from AWS Certificate Manager, or ACM. You request a certificate in ap-southeast-2 for your domain, like api.deanlofts.xyz, verify it via DNS or email, and attach it to the ALB’s 443 listener. Why HTTPS? Encrypts traffic and builds user trust.
The ALB has listeners — typically port 80 or 443. Each listener has rules. A rule says: if the request matches this condition, forward to this target group. A target group is a set of destinations, like ECS tasks or EC2 instances, with a health check path, say /health. If a target fails the health check, like returning 500 instead of 200, ALB stops sending traffic to it. Example: for your TechDeck app, you set a rule where host equals api.techdeck.life goes to the API target group, and host equals admin.techdeck.life goes to the admin target group. The default rule catches everything else, maybe returning a 404.
To set this up via CLI, you’d type aws space elbv2 space create-load-balancer space dash dash name space my-app-alb space dash dash subnets space subnet-id1 space subnet-id2 space dash dash security-groups space sg-id space dash dash scheme space internet-facing space dash dash type space application. Then create a target group: aws space elbv2 space create-target-group space dash dash name space api-targets space dash dash protocol space HTTP space dash dash port space 3000 space dash dash vpc-id space vpc-id space dash dash health-check-path space /health. Add a listener: aws space elbv2 space create-listener space dash dash load-balancer-arn space alb-arn space dash dash protocol space HTTPS space dash dash port space 443 space dash dash certificates space CertificateArn=acm-certificate-arn space dash dash default-actions space Type=forward,TargetGroupArn=target-group-arn. Why CLI? Automates setup, repeatable with scripts or Terraform (we’ll get there later).
Edge case: if health checks fail, check security groups — ensure the ALB can reach the target port. Example: your Rails app on ECS returns 503; you realize the ECS task’s security group blocks port 3000 from the ALB’s security group. Fix it, and traffic flows.
Next, Elastic Container Registry, or ECR. ECR is AWS’s private Docker registry. You store container images there for ECS or EKS to pull. To create a repo, type aws space ecr space create-repository space dash dash repository-name space my-rails-app space dash dash region space ap-southeast-2. This gives you a URI like 123456789012.dkr.ecr.ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com/my-rails-app. Why ECR? Private, secure, and integrated with AWS IAM.
To push an image, first authenticate Docker to ECR. Type aws space ecr space get-login-password space dash dash region space ap-southeast-2, then pipe it to docker space login space dash dash username space AWS space dash dash password-stdin space 123456789012.dkr.ecr.ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com. Build your image: docker space build space dash t space my-rails-app:latest space dot. Tag it: docker space tag space my-rails-app:latest space 123456789012.dkr.ecr.ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com/my-rails-app:latest. Push it: docker space push space 123456789012.dkr.ecr.ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com/my-rails-app:latest. Why these steps? Docker needs AWS credentials to push, and the tag matches the ECR URI.
Edge case: if pushing fails with “denied,” check your IAM permissions — you need ecr:PutImage. Example: you build a Rails image for LoftwahFM, tag it, push to ECR, and ECS pulls it later. For cleanup, set a lifecycle policy in ECR to delete images older than 30 days: aws space ecr space put-lifecycle-policy space dash dash repository-name space my-rails-app space dash dash lifecycle-policy-text space file://policy.json, where policy.json specifies rules like expire untagged images.
Now, Elastic Container Service, or ECS. ECS orchestrates Docker containers. It has two launch types: Fargate and EC2. Fargate is serverless — AWS manages the underlying servers, you just specify CPU and memory. EC2 means you manage a cluster of EC2 instances, and ECS schedules containers onto them. Fargate is simpler but pricier; EC2 is cheaper for steady loads but you handle scaling.
You start with a Task Definition, a JSON or YAML file describing your containers. It includes the image URI from ECR, CPU (like 256 units, or 0.25 vCPU), memory (like 512 MB), port mappings (like 3000 for Rails), environment variables, secrets from Secrets Manager, and logging to CloudWatch. Example: for your TechDeck app, you define a task with image 123456789012.dkr.ecr.ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com/techdeck:latest, 512 MB memory, 256 CPU, port 3000, and a log group /ecs/techdeck.
To create, type aws space ecs space register-task-definition space dash dash family space techdeck space dash dash container-definitions space file://task.json space dash dash execution-role-arn space arn:aws:iam::account-id:role/ecsTaskExecutionRole. The execution role needs permissions for ECR pull and CloudWatch logs. Why? ECS uses this role to fetch images and log.
Next, you create a Cluster: aws space ecs space create-cluster space dash dash cluster-name space techdeck-cluster. Then a Service to keep tasks running: aws space ecs space create-service space dash dash cluster space techdeck-cluster space dash dash service-name space techdeck-service space dash dash task-definition space techdeck:1 space dash dash desired-count space 2 space dash dash load-balancer space targetGroupArn=target-group-arn,containerName=techdeck,containerPort=3000. This runs two tasks, load-balanced by the ALB. Why services? Ensure tasks restart if they crash and scale as needed.
Edge case: if tasks fail to start, check CloudWatch logs — often it’s a missing IAM permission or wrong image tag. Example: your service deploys, but tasks exit; logs show “cannot pull image” because the tag was wrong. Fix by updating to techdeck:latest.
CodeBuild is AWS’s build service. It runs commands in a container based on a buildspec.yml file in your repo. The buildspec has phases: install (like installing Ruby), pre_build (like logging into ECR), build (like docker build), post_build (like pushing to ECR). Example: for your Rails app, buildspec.yml might install Ruby 3.2, run bundle install, build a Docker image, and push to ECR.
To create a project, type aws space codebuild space create-project space dash dash name space techdeck-build space dash dash source space type=GITHUB,location=https://github.com/yourname/techdeck.git space dash dash environment space type=LINUX_CONTAINER,image=aws/codebuild/standard:7.0 space dash dash service-role space arn:aws:iam::account-id:role/codebuild-role. Why? Automates builds. Example: push to GitHub, CodeBuild runs tests, builds image, pushes to ECR.
CodePipeline ties it together. It’s a CI/CD orchestrator with stages: Source, Build, Deploy. Source pulls from GitHub or CodeCommit. Build uses CodeBuild. Deploy updates ECS. Create with aws space codepipeline space create-pipeline space dash dash pipeline-name space techdeck-pipeline space dash dash pipeline space file://pipeline.json. Pipeline.json defines a GitHub source, a CodeBuild stage, and an ECS deploy stage. Why? Automates code to production. Example: push to main, pipeline builds, deploys to ECS, and your app is live.
Edge case: if the pipeline fails, check the CodeBuild role for ECR permissions or the ECS deploy action for service update permissions. Example: deploy fails; logs show “missing ecs:UpdateService” — add it to the role.
RDS with Postgres is your managed database. You choose an instance type like db.t3.micro, storage like 20 GB, and enable multi-AZ for failover. Create with aws space rds space create-db-instance space dash dash db-instance-identifier space techdeck-db space dash dash engine space postgres space dash dash engine-version space 15.5 space dash dash db-instance-class space db.t3.micro space dash dash allocated-storage space 20 space dash dash multi-az. Why multi-AZ? If the primary fails, AWS switches to the standby in another AZ. You connect using the endpoint, like techdeck-db.abcdef.ap-southeast-2.rds.amazonaws.com:5432, with a username and password stored in Secrets Manager.
For security, rotate credentials with Secrets Manager: aws space secretsmanager space create-secret space dash dash name space techdeck-db-credentials space dash dash secret-string space '{"username":"admin","password":"securepass"}'. Why? Auto-rotation reduces leak risk. Example: your Rails app uses the endpoint and rotated credentials to connect, queried via the AWS SDK.
ElastiCache Redis is for caching or background jobs. Create a cluster: aws space elasticache space create-cache-cluster space dash dash cache-cluster-id space techdeck-redis space dash dash engine space redis space dash dash engine-version space 7.0 space dash dash cache-node-type space cache.t3.micro space dash dash num-cache-nodes space 1. For replication, add --replicas-per-node-group 1. Connect using the primary endpoint, like techdeck-redis.abcdef.ap-southeast-2.cache.amazonaws.com:6379. Why Redis? Fast in-memory store for sessions or Sidekiq jobs. Example: your Rails app uses Redis for session storage, configured via the endpoint in your environment variables.
Edge case: if Redis connections fail, check security groups — ensure your ECS tasks can reach port 6379. Example: your app can’t connect; you find the ECS security group blocks Redis — add an inbound rule.
Tying it together: you configure ~/.aws/credentials and ~/.aws/config with profiles or SSO. You push images to ECR. ECS runs tasks from those images, load-balanced by ALB. CodeBuild and CodePipeline automate building and deploying from GitHub to ECS. RDS Postgres stores your data, ElastiCache Redis handles caching or jobs. IAM roles secure everything with least privilege. Monitor with CloudWatch logs and metrics.
