# Cover Letter — DevSecOps @ CrowdStrike (Example)

Hiring Manager,

What I want

- I’m applying for DevSecOps to strengthen software supply chain security and incident response while keeping delivery fast and safe.

Why me (match the JD)

- Supply Chain Hardening — Multi‑stage Docker builds, image scanning, artifact ownership and provenance strategy (demo-node-app/Dockerfile, docs/decisions/ADR-006-artifacts-bucket-policy-ownership.md, docs/validation-strategy.md).
- Least Privilege — Codified IAM/SG baselines and secrets patterns (docs/iam.md, docs/security-groups.md, aws-labs/kubernetes/manifests/_secrets_).
- Actionable Observability — SLOs/SLIs with Prometheus/Grafana; MTTR down via runbooks (aws-labs/16-observability, docs/runbooks/\*).

Proof

- Portfolio: CI/CD with deploy gates and scans; ALB/TLS and safe rollouts on EKS (`aws-labs/18-eks-alb-externaldns`).

Close

- Keen to discuss pragmatic controls that reduce risk without slowing teams down.

Regards,
Your Name
