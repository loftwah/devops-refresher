# Demo Walkthrough — TechDeck (2–3 minutes)

Goal

- Show an end‑to‑end AI pipeline, lean ops, and product thinking.

Flow

- 10s: One‑liner — “AI trading cards for tech profiles with a directory and API.”
- 20s: Problem → value — discovery on X is noisy; cards + directory + API create a high‑signal index.
- 40s: Architecture — Rails app; Stripe‑gated submissions ($3.50); solidqueue + Gemini pipeline; JSON endpoints; leaderboards.
- 40s: Ops — kamal deploys on DigitalOcean; simple, auditable releases; queue observability.
- 20s: Tie‑back — how this maps to CI/CD design, idempotency, and reliability.

Screen flow

- Show link hub → techdeck.life → submit flow (mock) → directory → example JSON.

Close

- “Happy to dig into the pipeline, data model, or operational safeguards as relevant to your stack.”
