# Project: LoftwahFM — Custom AI Music + Radio Segments

One-liner

- AI‑generated, royalty‑free music and podcast‑style radio segments from client briefs, streamed 24/7 or delivered as files. Faster, lower‑cost, and on‑brand.

What (Product)

- Custom tracks and branded radio segments, bundled into a seamless 24/7 playlist for venues and events.
- Subscription and one‑off offerings; venue playlists and monthly refresh options.

Why (Value)

- Avoids traditional licensing complexity (APRA AMCOS/ASCAP/BMI) by delivering original compositions.
- Rapid turnaround (“days, not weeks”) and lower cost vs. traditional studio work.

How (Tech)

- TypeScript, Astro, Cloudflare Workers, R2, D1.
- Script generation + AI voice for segments; looping audio and mixing for smooth transitions.

Outcomes (Privacy‑safe)

- Self‑hosted streaming demo available; stable ops and seamless loops.
- Clients receive royalty‑free tracks and ready‑to‑air segments; “no customer‑reported downtime” phrasing is acceptable where appropriate.

Resume bullets (pick 1–2)

- Built and productised an AI music + radio segment platform on Cloudflare Workers (TypeScript/Astro) with R2/D1 storage; delivered seamless 24/7 venue streams and downloadable assets.
- Implemented branded radio segment pipeline (script → AI voice → mastered segment) and integrated it into continuous venue playlists with privacy‑safe licensing posture.
