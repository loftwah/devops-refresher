# Stacks & Queues Pattern Hub

Stack and queue problems exercise state tracking, order preservation, and monotonic structuresâ€”perfect analogues for deployment pipelines, rate limiting, and incident command queues.

## Core Techniques

- **Stack Simulation**: Validate sequences, track nested state (parentheses, edit history).
- **Monotonic Stack**: Maintain ascending/descending order to find next greater/smaller elements.
- **Queue / BFS**: Level-order traversal, shortest paths when edges have uniform weight.

## Target Problems

- Valid Parentheses / Min Stack
- Daily Temperatures / Next Greater Element I & II
- Evaluate Reverse Polish Notation
- Binary Tree Level Order Traversal (queue-driven)
- Sliding Window Maximum (deque as monotonic queue)

## DevOps Parallels

- Managing LIFO/rollback operations in deployment tooling.
- Predicting when resource utilisation crosses thresholds using monotonic metrics.
- Processing incident queues breadth-first to understand blast radius.
