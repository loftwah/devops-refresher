Observability (CloudWatch): Logs, Metrics, Alerts, Dashboard

## What This Adds

- SNS topic `devops-refresher-staging-alerts` with email subscription to `dean+aws@deanlofts.xyz`.
- CloudWatch alarms:
  - ECS service CPU/Memory high (>= 80%).
  - ALB 5XX (ELB and target) and latency p95 > 1.5s.
  - Target group UnHealthyHostCount > 0.
  - RDS CPU high, FreeStorage low (< 2 GiB), FreeableMemory low.
  - Redis CPU high and Evictions > 0.
- CloudWatch dashboard `devops-refresher-staging` with ECS, ALB, RDS, Redis widgets.

## Assumptions

- Uses existing remote states from labs 12 (ALB), 13 (ECS cluster), 14 (ECS service), 09 (RDS), 10 (Redis).
- Naming matches existing resources (e.g., RDS `staging-app-postgres`, Redis replication group `staging-app-redis`).
- ECS task definition is already logging to CloudWatch Logs `/aws/ecs/devops-refresher-staging` (from lab 13).

## Usage

1. Initialize and apply:

   terraform -chdir=aws-labs/16-observability init
   terraform -chdir=aws-labs/16-observability apply -auto-approve

2. Confirm the email subscription sent to `dean+aws@deanlofts.xyz` so alarms can notify.

## Notes

- Assumes RDS and Redis labs are applied; alarms and widgets are created automatically.

## Log Retention and Costs

- By default, CloudWatch Logs groups have infinite retention, which can accumulate cost over time.
- This repo creates the main ECS log group with a 30â€‘day retention; set explicit retention on any additional groups you create.

## Logs Insights (Example)

Example: find recent 5xx responses from the app (if application logs include structured status fields):

```
fields @timestamp, @message
| filter status >= 500
| sort @timestamp desc
| limit 20
```

Or, for ALB logs (if enabled in your account/log group):

```
fields @timestamp, elb_status_code, target_status_code, request_url
| filter elb_status_code like /5../
| sort @timestamp desc
| limit 20
```

## Teardown

- Remove alarms and dashboard via `terraform destroy` in this folder after dependent services are gone (so metrics/ARN references cleanly detach).

## Additional Notes

- Alarms treat missing data as not breaching to avoid false positives during deploys.
- Thresholds are sane defaults; adjust via variables if needed.
- Dashboard renders in CloudWatch under `devops-refresher-staging`.
