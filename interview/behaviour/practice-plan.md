# Behavioural Practice Plan (2 Weeks)

Week 1

- Day 1: Draft 4 stories with `story-bank-template.md` (mix STAR/SOAR/SAO)
- Day 2: Record 2 stories (2–3 min each); review clarity and timing
- Day 3: Add metrics to each story; identify artefacts (runbooks/ADRs)
- Day 4: Convert 1 story to SAO (APS) 300 words
- Day 5: Mock with a friend; use `scoring-rubric.md`

Week 2

- Day 1: Draft 3 more stories (conflict, failure, leadership)
- Day 2: Record and tighten to 120s versions (CAR)
- Day 3: Add government‑safe phrasing/privacy checks where applicable
- Day 4: Rehearse branching answers (tooling → risk → stakeholders)
- Day 5: Full behavioural mock; capture notes and iterate
