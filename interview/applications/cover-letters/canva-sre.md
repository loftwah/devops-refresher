# Cover Letter — SRE @ Canva (Example)

Hiring Manager,

What I want

- I’m applying for SRE to improve reliability and user experience with clear SLOs, simple solutions, and fast recovery.

Why me (match the JD)

- SLOs & Observability — Implemented SLIs/SLOs with Prometheus/Grafana; cut Sev‑1s 40% (aws-labs/16-observability, docs/runbooks/\*).
- Simple, Safe Delivery — Canary/blue‑green on EKS with ALB; rollback <5 min (aws-labs/18-eks-alb-externaldns, demo-node-app/deploy/eks/chart/).
- Scale & Cost Awareness — Reusable CI/CD and Helm templates; p95 pipeline <15m (aws-labs/20-cicd-eks-pipeline).

Proof

- Portfolio: end‑to‑end platform builds, incident runbooks, and ADRs describing trade‑offs.

Close

- I’d love to chat about how to keep Canva fast and reliable with data‑informed, simple solutions.

Regards,
Your Name
